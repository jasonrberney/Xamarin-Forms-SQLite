# Xamarin-Forms-SQLite

Repository was created to explore a Xamarin Forms application using SQLite as the backend database. I have been researching mobile development technologies and my experience with C# drove my decision to try Xamarin Forms. I was very curious how to use local storage on a mobile device, and that is why this repository was created. This repository mainly follows an online tutorial that can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhWwBOoqXQ8.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Software you'll need to run the project

```
Visual Studio 2017
sqlite-net-pcl
A mobile device or use Visual Studio Simulator
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
git clone https://github.com/jasonrberney/Xamarin-Forms-SQLite
cd Xamarin-Forms-SQLite
Open the .sln
```

If you already have Visual Studio installed then you may need to modify your installation to include Xamarin, Android SDK's and/or Cross-Platform Mobile Development tools. If you are going with a fresh install of Visual Studio, make sure to check the Xamarin docs ([here](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/installation/windows/)) to see what you should install.
